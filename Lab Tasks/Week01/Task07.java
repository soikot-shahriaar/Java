/* Write the Java code of a program that reads an integer, and prints the integer it is a multiple of  either 2 or 5 but not both. If the number is a multiple of 2 and 5 both, then print "Multiple of 2 and 5 both". For all other numbers, the program prints "Not a multiple we want".  
For Example: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 22 â€¦ i.e. this includes multiples of 2 only and multiples of 5 only, NOT multiples of 2 and 5 both or other numbers.  
Hint(1): We may use the modulus (%) operator for checking the divisibility.
Hint(2): We can consider the number to be an integer. 

Sample Input:  
6  
Sample Output:  
6  
Sample Input:  
17
Sample Output:  
Not a multiple we want
