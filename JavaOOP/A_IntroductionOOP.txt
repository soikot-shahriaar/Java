What is Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of designing software by using "objects." 
These objects are like virtual things that we can create and interact with in our code. 
Each object is made from a blueprint called a class.



*** Key Concepts of OOP ***

1. Classes and Objects:

Class: Think of a class as a recipe. 
       It tells us what ingredients (data) and steps (actions) are needed to create something.
       Example: Think of a "class" as a recipe for baking cookies. 
       The recipe tells us what ingredients (like flour, sugar, and eggs) we need and the steps to follow.

Object: An object is what we get when we follow the recipe. 
       It's a specific version of the class.
       Example: An "object" is the actual cookie we bake using the recipe. 
       If we follow the recipe multiple times, we can create several cookies, each being an individual object based on the same class (recipe).


2. Encapsulation:

This is about keeping everything related to a specific object together in one place (the class). 
It also means keeping some details hidden so that they can't be accidentally changed.

Example: Imagine a remote control for TV. The remote has buttons to change the channel or volume. 
We don’t need to know how the remote works internally; we just press the buttons. 
The internal workings of the remote (like the circuits) are hidden from us, and we can only interact with it through the buttons.
This is like encapsulation, where certain details are hidden and only the necessary parts are exposed.


3. Inheritance:

Inheritance lets us create a new class based on an existing one. The new class automatically gets all the features of the old one, but we can add more features if we want.

Example: Think of a family tree. Our parents pass on certain traits to us, like eye color or hair type. 
Similarly, in OOP, a "child class" inherits traits (attributes and methods) from a "parent class."
For instance, if there’s a general "Vehicle" class that describes common features like having wheels, 
a "Car" class can inherit from Vehicle and add more specific details, like the number of doors.


4. Polymorphism:

Polymorphism means that objects from different classes can be treated as if they are from the same class, especially if they share the same methods. 
It's like having one method that can do different things depending on the object.

Example: Imagine we have a universal remote that can control TV, DVD player, and stereo. 
Even though these devices are different, we can use the same remote to operate all of them.
In OOP, polymorphism is like using the same interface (the remote) to work with different types of objects (TV, DVD player, stereo),
each responding in its own way when we press a button.


5. Abstraction:

Abstraction is about showing only what is necessary and hiding the rest. It helps to keep things simple by not showing the complex details.
Example: Think about how we use a coffee machine. We press a button, and it makes coffee. 
We don’t need to know how the machine grinds the beans or heats the water; we just care about getting our coffee.
Abstraction in OOP is similar: it hides the complicated details and only shows us what we need to know to use it, making things simpler and easier to manage.



*** Modeling the Problem in OOP ***

Noun (Class): What it is: The noun represents the things or entities we want to model in our program.
              Example: Imagine we're building a system to manage employees in a company. 
              The Employee is the noun, so we would create an "Employee" class.

Adjective (Attributes): What it describes: Adjectives describe the characteristics or features of the entity.
                        Example: For the Employee class, the attributes could be things like the employee's name, age, and salary.
                        These are the qualities that define each employee.

Verb (Methods): What it does: Verbs represent the actions or behaviors that the entity can perform.
                Example: For an Employee, we might have methods like getSalary() to find out the employee's salary or increment() to increase the salary. 
                These are the actions an employee can perform or have done to them.


*** Why Use OOP? ***

Modularity: Organizes code into manageable parts (classes/objects).
Reusability: Allows reuse of existing classes in new projects.
Maintainability: Keeps data and methods safe and easy to update.
Flexibility: Simplifies handling complex tasks with adaptable code.
