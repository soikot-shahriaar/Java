/* Write a Java program that reads a string containing 7 numbers separated by commas, 
then makes a list of those numbers and prints the largest number and its location or index position in the list. 
Hint01: You are not allowed to use the max(), sort(), sorted() function here.
Hint02: You may assume the first input to be the largest value initially and the largest valueâ€™s location to be 0.
Hint03: Program should work for any lists, make changes to the lists below and check whether your program works correctly.
Hint04: You may need to be careful while printing the output. Depending on your code, you might need data conversion.

Sample Input:
7, 13, 2, 10, 6, -11, 0
Sample Output:
My list: [7, 13, 2, 10, 6, -11, 0]
Largest number in the list is 13 which was found at index 1
